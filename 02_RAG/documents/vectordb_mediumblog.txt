“If 2021 was the year of graph databases, 2023 is the year of vector databases” — Chip Huen.

Well, it’s because Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are now popular and one of the best ways to handle LLM data is with a vector database because vector databases provide the ideal infrastructure for managing the complex, high-dimensional data that LLMs produce and thrive on.

In this article, we’ll discuss what vector databases are, how they work, and some excellent vector database tools you should check out.
Before we dive into vector databases, let’s first understand what a vector is.

What is a Vector?
In machine learning (ML), a vector is a collection of numerical values that represent the characteristics or features of multi-dimensional objects such as words, images, etc.
For example, a vector representing an image might contain values corresponding to the pixel intensities of the image, in the order of the image’s color channels.

What are Embeddings?
An embedding is a technique for representing complex data, such as images, text, or audio, as numerical vectors.
These embeddings capture the essence of the data and show clearly the semantic similarity (or relationship) between different objects, with similar objects having vectors that are close to each other in the vector space. Thus, ML algorithms allow them to be efficiently processed and analyzed.

ML models often generate embeddings as part of their training process. For LLMs, an embedding model is put in place to create the embeddings

Embeddings are vectors that represent the essential features of a data point. For example, a natural language processing model might generate embeddings for words or sentences.
Embeddings can be used for a variety of tasks, such as clustering, classification, and anomaly detection. Vector databases can be used to store and query embeddings efficiently, which makes them ideal for ML applications.

To see what embeddings look like, check out this Vectorizer created by Kenny, it converts texts to embeddings.

Note: An embedding is a vector representation, but not all vectors are embeddings.
Putting it all together, let us define a vector database.

What is a Vector Database?
A vector database is a type of database that stores and manages unstructured data, such as text, images, or audio, in high-dimensional vectors, to make it easy to find and retrieve similar objects quickly at scale in production.
They work by using algorithms like vector similarity search to index and query vector embeddings,

The importance of vector databases in LLM projects lies in their ability to provide easy search, high performance, scalability, and data retrieval by comparing values and finding similarities between them

Vector database’s search capabilities can be used in various applications ranging from classical ML use cases, such as recommender systems, to providing long-term memory to large language models in modern applications, to text understanding, video summarization, drug discovery, stock market analysis, and much more.
As data continues to grow in complexity and volume, the scalability, speed, and accuracy offered by vector databases position them as a critical tool for extracting meaningful insights and unlocking new opportunities across various domains.

What are the benefits of Vector Databases?
Here are some specific reasons why vector databases are so well-suited for LLMs and generative AI:
Handling Massive Data Loads: Vector databases can handle the massive amounts of data that are generated by LLMs and generative AI. Traditional databases might struggle with the millions or even billions of data points produced in a single run, but vector databases are purpose-built to handle such large datasets with efficiency.
Efficient Similarity Searches: Vector databases can find data that is similar to a given query vector. This is essential for tasks such as image search and content recommendation, which are often used in conjunction with LLMs and generative AI. For example, if you are using an LLM to generate a new image, you can use a vector database to find other images that are similar to the generated image.
Integration with ML Algorithms: Vector databases can be integrated with machine learning algorithms. This makes it easy to use vector databases to train and evaluate machine learning models. For example, you can use a vector database to store the data that is used to train a model, and then use the vector database to search for the data that is most relevant to the model.
Handling Vector Embeddings: Vector databases provide a superior solution for handling vector embeddings by addressing the limitations of standalone vector indices, such as scalability challenges, cumbersome integration processes, and the absence of real-time updates and built-in security measures.

List of Some Top Vector Databases
There are several vector database solutions available in the market, each with its own set of features and capabilities. Some of the top vector database solutions include: Weaviate, Pinecone, Chroma DB, Qdrant, Milvus

How To Choose The Right Vector Database For Your LLM Projects
To choose the right vector database for LLM projects, there are some factors you should consider. They include:

Scalability: Since LLMs generate and consume vast amounts of vector data, it is best to choose a database that can efficiently store and manage large-scale datasets without compromising performance. Also, the vector database must be able to seamlessly handle future data additions and expansion of your LLM project’s scope.

Performance: It should deliver fast query execution and swift retrieval of relevant vectors. It should also efficiently handle multi-dimensional queries and complex similarity searches.

Security: The database should provide robust security features, including encryption, access controls, and authentication mechanisms. For use cases with personal or sensitive data, the vector database should align with applicable privacy regulations.

Cost: Using LLM APIs already costs a fortune when running at scale, so you look out for a vector base. with flexible pricing models and one that fits your use case.

Query interfaces: Evaluate the ease of interaction with the database, including available query languages, APIs, and user interfaces.

Deployment options: Make sure the vector database whether cloud-based, on-premise, or hybrid solutions matches your infrastructure preferences and data sensitivity.
Integration capabilities: Ensure seamless integration with your existing LLM infrastructure and other tools in your workflow.
